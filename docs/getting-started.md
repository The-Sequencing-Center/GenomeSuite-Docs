# Getting Started

GenomeSuite Analyzer runs on the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) platform.  
* If you do not have an AWS account, start with the "Create AWS Account" instructions below.  
* If you do have an AWS account, you can skip to the step "Login to AWS Account".

Some steps are identified as a “**one-time step**”.  This means you should only have to perform this step **one-time** and not have to do it again.
